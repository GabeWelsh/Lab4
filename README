What else could we add to our application? 
List at least two functionalities that you would want to add to this lab. 
For each one, list why it would be useful.

We could add functionality to print the tree in a graph form rather than going over it with a pre-order traversal.
This would be useful for the user to more clearly see what the tree looks like without having to slowly look through 
the pre-ordered list.

Add a new option to print a specific participant's stats.
This would be useful if you would want to find out exactly what someone has done.
